Phing tasks
===========

Just a simple collection of [phing](http://phing.info/trac/) tasks.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the appropriate task to a subfolder within the tasks folder of your local phing install.  On
my Ubuntu machine, that is within /usr/share/php/phing/tasks.  You will also need to register the new task using the
`taskdef` task within phing.
